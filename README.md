# Reinforcement Learning Side Projects

## Current Projects
- Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction ([projects/rl-an-intro](https://github.com/rgross-utexas/reinforcement-learning/tree/main/projects/rl-an-intro))
  - After my course in  Reinforcement Learning in the Master of Science in Data Science at the University of Texas at Austin, I decided I wanted to solidify my understanding of the subject. This (incomplete) project contains implementations of many of the algorithms and examples in the book [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf)
- Yahtzee (very much a WIP) ([projects/yahtzee](https://github.com/rgross-utexas/reinforcement-learning/tree/main/projects/yahtzee))
