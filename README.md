# Reinforcement Learning Side Projects

## Current Projects
- Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction
  - After my course in  Reinforcement Learning in the Master of Science in Data Science at the University of Texas at Austin, I decided I wanted to solidify my understanding of the subject. This (incomplete) project contains implementations of many of the algorithms and examples in the book [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf)
